\subsection{Device}
\subsubsection{Python}
Libraries
\begin{enumerate}
 \item python-serial
 \item SocketIO
\end{enumerate}
\paragraph{Threads}
The application on the Raspberry Pi uses threads so the application can simultaneously read data from the Serial Interface to the Arduino and send data to the local database or the server.
\subsubsection{MySQL}
When the application can't send data to the remote server, all data is stored on a local MySQL database. MySQL is an open source relational database engine.
\subsubsection{Web sockets}

\subsection{Web interface}
\subsubsection{Javascript}
Javascript is a programing language used to program the behavior of a web page.
It is easy to implement in a HTML file. An advantage of Javascript is that it is
executed on the client side. This way, the web server won't unnecessarily be strained.
A disadvantage is that a lot of lines have to be written in order to get some basic
functionality. In this project, Javascript is used to create all functionality on the
client side. Without Javascript, the client side would not be able to get any data from
the server and would thus be useless. 

\subsubsection{JQuery}
Jquery is a JavaScript library, created to simplify JavaScript programming. Using JQuery,
lots of commands are a lot easier and faster to use. In every JavaScript file used in this
project, JQuery commands are present.

\subsubsection{DataTables} 
For the calendar, an external Jquery library 'DataTables' was used. This library makes
working with HTML tables a whole lot easier. It provides asynchronous initialisation,
pagination, sorting, etc.

\subsubsection{ScrollTo}
When a calendar day is clicked, detailed information for that day is presented in a
details section beneath the calendar. To automatically scroll down to this view, we
used the external jQuery ScrollTo library. This library still presents a few bugs, so we
are still looking for an alternative.

\subsubsection{Chart}
Chart is an external jQuery library for making charts. We have not used this library yet,
but it seemed easy to use and supports nice animations.

\subsubsection{JSON}
JSON is a data interchange format. Although it stands for JavaScript Object Notation, it
is language independent. JSON is relatively easy to understand and is faster than other
similar formats. In this project, JSON is used for data interchange between the client
side and the databank.
