\section{Conclusion}
We already learned a lot in this project. First of all we learned how to combine an
Arduino with a Raspberry Pi. Secondly we learned a lot about web technologies. We now
know how to write webpages using a combination of HTML, CSS and javascript (with
jQuery). Thirdly we learned how to use the version management system called git.
We think the introduction sessions where good. They weren't too long and they gave
a short summary of what every technology was meant for. Those who didn't know these
technologies yet could go through some tutorials. We only think it is too bad that it's
not a augmented bike project. It would have been easier to imagine oneself who would buy
our application and what they would use it for.

We still plan to make use of SCSS, to easily change global parameters like our base colour.
